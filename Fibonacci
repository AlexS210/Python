# Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them.
# Take this opportunity to think about how you can use functions. Make sure to ask the user to enter the number
# of numbers in the sequence to generate.(Hint: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number
# in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)

seq_length = int(input('Sequence length: '))
result = []


def fibonnaci_func():
    for x in range(0, seq_length):
        if x < 2:
            result.append(1)
        else:
            result.append(result[x-1] + result[x-2])
    print(result)
