# Use the BeautifulSoup and requests Python packages to print out a list of all the article titles on the New York Times homepage

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

# Assign URL
url = "http://www.nytimes.com/"

# Fetch raw HTML content
html_content = requests.get(url).text

# Now that the content is ready, iterate
# through the content using BeautifulSoup:
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, "html.parser")

# similarly to get all the occurrences of a given tag
print(soup.find('title').text)
