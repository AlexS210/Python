# Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25])
# and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. For practice, write this code inside a function.

a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]


def first_and_last(list_of_numbers):
    return list_of_numbers[0], list_of_numbers[-1]


result = first_and_last(a)
print(result)
