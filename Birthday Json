# In this exercise, modify your program from Part 1 to load the birthday dictionary
# from a JSON file on disk, rather than having the dictionary defined in the program.

# Bonus: Ask the user for another scientist’s name and birthday to add to the dictionary,
# and update the JSON file you have on disk with the scientist’s name. If you run the program
# multiple times and keep adding new names, your JSON file should keep getting bigger and bigger.
