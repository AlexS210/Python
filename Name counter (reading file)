# Instead of using the .txt file from above (or instead of, if you want the challenge), take this .txt file,
# and count how many of each “category” of each image there are. This text file is actually a list of files
# corresponding to the SUN database scene recognition database, and lists the file directory hierarchy for the images.
# Once you take a look at the first line or two of the file, it will be clear which part represents the scene category.
